Abstract

The field of nanoscience has produced more hype than probably any other branch of materials
science and engineering in its history. Still, the potentials of this new field largely lay
undiscovered ahead of us; what we have learnt so far with respect to the peculiarity of physical
processes on the nanoscale is only the tip of an iceberg. Elaborated in this critical review is the
idea that the surge of interest in physical chemistry of phenomena at the nanoscale presents a
natural consequence of the spatial refinement of the human ability to controllably manipulate the
substratum of our physical reality. Examples are given to illustrate the sensitivity of material
properties to grain size on the nanoscale, a phenomenon that directly contributed to the rise of
nanoscience as a special field of scientific inquiry. Main systemic challenges faced by the present
and future scientists in this field are also mentioned. In part, this perspective article resembles
standing on the constantly expanding seashore of the coast of nanoscience and nanoengineering
and envisioning the parts of the island where the most significant advances may be expected to
occur and where, therefore, most of the attention of scientist in this field is to be directed: (a)
crossing the gap between life science and materials science; (b) increasing experimentation
sensitivity; (c) crisscrossing theory and experiments; and (d) conjoining top-down and bottom-up
synthetic approaches. As for materials and the application areas discussed, a special emphasis is
placed on calcium phosphate nanoparticles and their usage in controlled drug delivery devices and
other applications of biomedical relevance. It is argued that the properties of nanoparticles as drug
carriers often comprise the critical determinant for the efficacy of the drug therapy. Therefore, the
basic properties of nanoparticles to be optimized for the purpose of maximizing this efficacy are
discussed: size, size distribution, morphology, polymorphic nature, crystallinity, biocompatibility,
biodegradability, drug elution profiles, and aggregation propensity.

Although nanoparticles have existed on the planet Earth since the earliest days of its cosmic
conception, nanoscience stands for one of the newest and most prosperous subfields of
materials science. Unequivocal beliefs are shared in its potential to revolutionize all fields of
natural sciences. This section will explicate the causes behind the birth of this scientific
discipline. Since the total body of its knowledge is comparable to the tip of an iceberg, it can
be considered to still exist in the embryonic stage of its development. The following sections
in the discourse will focus on the formulation of some of the central systemic challenges that
will be faced on the path of its growth and maturation.

The progress of humanity throughout the history has corresponded to a gradual increase in
the fineness with which we are able to controllably reshape the material substrate of our
environment.1 As shown in Figure 1, critical boundaries incorporated within the products of
human creativity have thus been created at an ever finer scale. As the result, we have
witnessed miniaturization of devices in our everyday surrounding. The natural consequence
of this is that, as of a few decades ago, materials science has entered the era of controlling
physical processes at the nanoscale. Potentials for producing ever more potent technological
and biomedical applications have thus arisen. Yet, as the limits in controllability are
stretched more than ever, questions have been posed: how far would we be able to go from
now on? Certainly, in the realm of nanoscience, advances are not only possible, but seem
inevitable too. The discourse that follows is organized around an attempt to outline some of
the provinces within the kingdom of nanoscience where the most critical advances may be
expected to be made in the near future. At the same time, those could be seen as currently
the most exciting frontiers in the investigation of physical phenomena at the nanoscale.

One of the underlying premises of materials science is that properties of materials can be
deduced from the known microstructure, the term that describes ways in which the perfect
symmetry of an ideal crystal of a given composition is disrupted by imperfections. In
addition to intracrystalline defects, these intrinsic imperfections are also directly
proportional to the concentration of grain boundaries, which is, in turn, inversely
proportional to the grain size. Consequently, many are physical properties that could be
described as a function of the size of the grains, alongside their shape, orientation, spatial
distribution, etc. Nanoscience as a special field of inquiry spontaneously emerged a couple
of decades ago as a branch of physical chemistry of solid state from the need to explain
peculiarities observed upon extrapolation of specific physical qualities that are a function of
the grain size and entrance into the size region lower than 100 nm (Fig. 2(a)). Namely, the
competition between high interfacial energy and the quantum nature of many physical
properties at such a small scale produces drastic changes in the properties of materials
following negligible modifications of the particle size, polydispersity, inter-particle
interaction or morphology. The first observation of such deviations from a law that describes
a physical property of a material as a function of its grain size came from the failure of the
Hall-Petch law.2 Namely, although the latter suggests inverse proportionality between the
grain size and yield strength (the stress under which the material begins to deform
plastically) due to the ability of grain boundaries to impede the movement of dislocations,
Figure 2(b) demonstrates a typical drastic drop in microhardness at sufficiently low,
sub-100-nm particle sizes and the consequent deviation from the function predicted by the
Hall-Petch relationship.

Other examples of such dramatic changes in material properties upon seemingly minor
variations in the particle size are given in Figures 3–7. In Figure 3(a), shown is the melting
point of Al2O3–Cr2O3 alloy, approximately constant with respect to the chromate content,
but greatly depending on the particle size when the latter reaches the nanosized range6 (<
100 nm by convention,3 although this limit is often taken to be 300 nm in the biomedical
milieu4). A greater difference in the melting point is produced by a drop in the particle size
from 20 to 8 nm than by reducing the particle diameter from 100 to 20 nm, demonstrating
that not only does a micro-to-nano transition in the grain size of a material entail drastic
changes in the material properties, but also that a minor change in the grain size at the
nanoscale can have far more drastic effects on the materials properties than the very
transition from bulk to nano. Figure 3(b) shows the melting temperature of indium as
dependent not only on the particle size, but on the method of preparation too; thus, a sample
prepared by ball-milling exhibits the melting point that exponentially decreases with a
decrease in the particle size, while an opposite trend is displayed by the sample synthesized
by melt-spinning7 (Fig. 3(b)). This highlights another truism of particularly critical

relevance for the field of nanoscience: the method of preparation oftentimes has a crucial
effect on the materials properties.

The phase diagram for a germanium-based alloy is shown to drastically differ depending on
whether the particle size is 32 or 54 nm8 (Fig. 3(c)). Local density of states, a measure of the
band gap of a conductive material, is then shown to depend on the particle size and reaches
values around 1, indicating the virtual nonexistence of the band gap and thus the loss of
conductivity of metallic particles (Fig. 3(d)). A similar conductor-to-insulator transition
induced by a decrease in the particle size is displayed in Figure 4(a)–(b) for the case of
nanostructured Nb films.9 The logarithmic dependence of resistivity on the particle size
shown in Figure 4(b) dictates that the transition from micrograins to 10-nm-sized particles
produces the same magnitude of increase in resistivity as the transition from 10-nm-sized
particles to 5-nm-sized ones does.

The peculiarities entailed by micro-to-nano structural transitions are further illustrated by the
fact that most metals become insulators when their particles size reaches nano scale, and that
as the result of the reduced free path of electrons traversing disordered grain boundary. On
the other hand, some ceramics undergo the opposite transition and become conductive in the
nanoparticulate form, the effect that is either associated with increased concentration of
vacancies along the grain boundary with decreasing grain size, contributing to higher lattice
entropy and higher ionic conductivity, as in the case of CaO10 (Fig. 4(c)) and ZrO2-Y2O3,12
or is due to electronic conductivity resulting from the accumulation of free electrons in the
space charge layer at the grain boundary, as in the case of CeO2 (Fig. 4(d)). Figure 4(d)
shows how electrical conductivity of Gd-doped cerium oxide increases in direct proportion
to the grain boundary surface area per unit mass.11 How dramatic this change in the overall
conductivity of the material can be is demonstrated by the case of rutile,13 TiO2, where a
fivefold reduction in the particle size, from 260 to 50 nm, led to a few thousands of times
higher conductivity, from 1.4 · 10−6 to 4 · 10−3  −1 cm −1. As for magnetic properties of
materials, ferromagnetic compounds in their bulk form typically transform to one of two
forms of paramagnetism as their magnetic domain size begins to exceed the particle size: (a)
regular paramagnetism in cases when the combination of surface relaxation, lattice
expansion and incorporation of impurities interferes with the magnetic ordering to a drastic
enough extent, or (b) superparamagnetism in cases when magnetic ordering in the particle
core is still sufficient to enable significant collective dipole orientation in the external field
(Fig. 5(a)). On much rarer occasions, however, observable is the opposite effect:
transformation of a paramagnetic material to a ferromagnetic one paralleling the bulk-to-
nano transition, as exemplified by the case of ZnFe2O4 (Fig. 5(b)). Figure 5(c)–(d)
furthermore shows the effect of increased sensitivity of sensory surfaces of SnO2 and In2O3
to different gases as a result of the smaller particle size and increased surface area. The
increased reactivity of nanoscale surfaces is an effect utilized in various biomedical
microelectromechanical systems (Bio-MEMS) for detection of physicochemical agents,
including disease biomarkers, at ultralow concentrations.14,15

Surface effects are, however, only one reason behind the appearance of novel properties of
materials when their grain sizes become reduced to nano scale. Namely, as the particle size
decreases, more and more atoms find themselves positioned on the comparatively disordered
particle surface and exposed to greater interfacial energies than those experienced by the
atoms in the interior of the particle (Fig. 6(a)). For example, a half of the atoms comprising a
spherical particle with 3 nm in diameter reside on the particle surface. Another effect
coupled to the surface one comes from the quantum confinement apparent when the critical
dimensions for a physical quality, often defined by the particle size limits, become
comparable to the wavelength of the wave function used to describe the given quality in
quantum terms. Quantum confinement effect is demonstrated in Figure 6(b) on standing

waves that fit within a resonance box only in specific wavelengths, without permitting any
intermediate wavelengths to occur. In other words, as the space in which the physical quality
describable by the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation becomes limited, the given
quality tends to adopt very specific and well defined states. Quantization, that is, formation
of discrete, precisely determined and oftentimes tunable energy levels takes place under
such conditions of confinement. Figure 7 thus demonstrates how a seemingly minor change
in the size of Ag and Au particles modifies their quantum states and thereby the optical
response. The color of the particle sols correspondingly becomes tunable by controlling the
particle size as well as their shape.

All in all, systematic observation of these and other peculiarities occurring at the nanoscale
and a belief that they could be explained within a single framework of thought led to the rise
of a special new scientific discipline: nanoscience, or the science of the small, as it has been
informally baptized.

CROSSING THE GAP BETWEEN LIFE SCIENCE AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
If you think that the first line in this section has been inadvertently indented, you are wrong.
It was intentionally drawn to signify nothingness: pure blankness in space and time.

This is how this section will start. And then a question: “What results from our staring for
too long at a single patch of reality?” Blindness, you might say. For, to observe qualities in
physical systems, we need to compare their features with some remote standards. For this
reason, Rudyard Kipling lamented, “Who knows England who only England knows.” 21
This is why I will draw a bridge (Fig. 8), place materials scientists on one coast, life
scientists on the other, and invite you to walk towards the opposite coast from the one that
you have inhabited. The hypothesis I offer here is that great things could be learned not only
of the side onto which we step, but also of the one that we have temporarily left behind.

As we climb from the complexity level of fundamental physics to those of chemistry,
biochemistry and molecular biology, biology, psychology, anthropology, ecology, sociology
and other social sciences, scientific approaches become less intricate despite the fact that the
systems subjected to our scrutiny are, in reality, more complex. This impoverishment of
methodological intricacy is naturally reflected in a lesser emphasis on rigorous and ultrafine
quantification. Peering into a biochemistry lab for the first time, physical chemists gotten
used to exceptional precision in experimentation thus often become surprised realizing how
approximate concentrations of chemicals used in reactions are. Partially, this is in
accordance with the highly pronounced qualitative character of molecular biology, naturally
arising from the fundamental reliance on molecular recognition effects in the research
methodology that is paradigmatic in life science labs. On the other hand, it is a logical
response of scientists to dealing with highly unpredictable and hardly controllable systems,
which even the simplest conceivable biological structures are. For, with this ascent from the
atomic scale to the macroscopic scale, the systems subjected to scientific scrutiny become so
complex that they require significant simplification thereof lest the practicality of the given
scientific methodologies be threatened. And as investigated systems become less complex in
the schemes of their investigators, so does the complexity of the exploratory approach
applied become spontaneously reduced. The mathematical representations of
physicochemical phenomena in the range of materials science, dealing with finer and less
dynamic details of Nature, are thus markedly more intricate than those used to represent the
biochemical phenomena where the statistical regimes and approximations that limit the
ability to scrupulously study these phenomena on the quantum scale begin to reign. Needless
to add, all these things contribute to the tremendous gap between materials scientists and life
scientists of the modern day, despite the fact that the most exciting research takes place

exactly along their intersections. However, as is the case with all the interdisciplinary areas
of our inquiry, they demarcate both the riskiest and the most potentially rewarding areas of
research. This, on the other hand, explains why the majority of scientists—naturally inclined
to stay in the safety of their narrow fields of specialization and remain diligent paradigm-
builders instead of groundbreaking paradigm-shifters—decide to avoid those challenging
interdisciplinary encounters. Today, they are still entered mainly by those whose curiosity
lives up to the norm ‘who dares, wins.’

A vital challenge for this brave new type of scientists that dwell on any of these two
mainstream sides of the contemporary research is to build a bridge that connects them and
do exciting research either right on it or on their own respective coasts while carrying
precious goods and insights across this bridge. The symptoms of the gap between the two
fields, however, could be recognized in different methods and vocabularies that biological
and materials scientists employ to describe and fundamentally understand the subjects of
their inquiry. Whether the former talk about polymerase chain reactions, various blots and in
vitro assays, or the latter refer to photonics, semiconductors or crystal growth phenomena,
most core materials and life scientists find the terms from an opposite field
incomprehensible. Even identical terms sometimes have completely different connotations,
as the example of the Latin phrase ‘in situ’ can demonstrate. While it signifies RNA
expression assays for a life scientist, it stands for real-time sensors or syntheses that yield a
desired material instantaneously, with no need for post-processing treatments, among
materials scientists.

While the former mostly tackle highly specific molecular recognition properties of
biomolecules, the latter rely on more robust, math-based and classical physical concepts.
Yet, it is an inevitable challenge for the frontiers of materials science, and especially its nano
fields, to adopt synthetic and characterization approaches applied in life sciences.
Biomedical contexts of a large extent of the modern materials science research dictate
that.22–24 Many biocombinatorial screening techniques, including selective adsorption using
phage display panning techniques, successfully applied to assess specificity of protein-
nanomaterial interactions, have led to important and highly functional organic-inorganic
interfaces, alongside room temperature procedures for preparation of oxides, ranging from
copper oxide25 to calcium molybdate26 to germanium oxide,27 all of which would have
otherwise required high annealing temperatures for their formation. However, although
numerous highly specific interactions between polypeptides and inorganic surfaces were
elucidated and applied using this technique, it still does not allow for discerning the aspects
of crystal formation on which the proteins have the most decisive influence: nucleation,
diffusion or surface-controlled crystal growth, aggregation of subunits, morphological
evolution during aging, et cetera (strictly speaking, all of these aspects are intertwined and
affecting one of them is hardly possible without affecting all the other). Clearly, a successful
rapprochement of the language of life scientists and materials scientist, the former of whom
would bring in the knowledge of the kinetics of protein conformational changes, adsorption
and assembly and the latter of whom would contribute with the knowledge on the crystal
faceting and growth, conditions yielding answers to these and similar questions.

Standing on the bridge that connects these two fields, one would also be able to understand
better the currently odd and unexpected effects of nanoparticles on cells and organisms.29
Namely, depending on the particle composition, surface chemistry and stiffness, as well as
the experimental context in which they are assessed, nanoparticles can be more or less toxic
than their microsized counterparts. For example, 20-nm sized polytetrafluoroethylene
particles turn out to be toxic and the 130-nm ones harmless,30 whereas 25-nm sized CeO2
particles are safe and 250-nm ones are toxic.31 Also, minor changes in the particle size
sometimes have dramatic effects on their biodistribution or cellular uptake profiles.

Dendrimers with 3–6 nm in size were thus rapidly excreted through the kidneys, while the
6–8 nm sized particles localized in tumor tissues and 15-nm sized ones were taken up by the
macrophages.32 In another study, the uptake efficiency peaked for 50-nm sized gold
nanoparticles and decreased in a size-dependent manner at both smaller and larger size
ranges.33 Other studies came to conclusion that 20–25 nm is the optimal size for the cellular
uptake of gold nanoparticles, indicating that smaller is not necessarily better.34,35 The
uptake of 50-nm sized polystyrene nanoparticles by human intestinal Caco-2 cells was, on
the other hand, smaller than for any particles in the 0.1–1 µm range,36 suggesting that not
only are countless particle properties, including, naturally, the synthesis method,37 involved
in defining the nanoparticlecell interaction, but the cell type and metabolism too. Then,
displayed in Figure 9 is the percentage of depolarized human alveolar basal epithelial cells,
directly indicative of mitochondrial damage, following incubation with micro- and nano-
particles of different chemical composition. Interestingly, only in the case of copper oxide
did nanoparticles induce a significantly more damaging effect—reflected in DNA damage
and reduced cell viability too—than their microsized counterparts. Although most
commercially applied nanoparticles are either confined within functional devices or coated
with protective layers, which minimizes their exposure to air and thus mitigates their
possible toxic effects,38 toxicity assessments are expected to attract more funding in future.
This is especially so since it is known that not only are material properties often subject to
dramatic changes as the grain size decreases down to the nanoscale, but the same effect
applies to the biological response to them.39 In fact, the field of nanoscience arose to explain
peculiar effects that nanosized particles exhibited in comparison with their bulk counterparts
in the context of physics and chemistry, and assessing the same from different angles may
lead to the birth of many new natural and social science fields of inquiry.

Central to the development of biomedicine are, similarly, not only physical pathologies, but
the necessity of successful medical treatments to induce an inflammatory response at first.
Namely, a medical body of knowledge in bone repair using exogenous implants could
remind us that every successful implantation of a biomaterial is followed by a certain degree
of inflammation. Avoiding the latter would imply a complete inertness of the body to the
foreign material, which would signify all but a healthy and sensitive response. Mild
inflammation attracts leukocytes and macrophages and stimulates blood vessels, thus
promoting regeneration of the tissue. The more of the regenerative growth, the less of the
fibroblast accumulation and the lesser the chance for the formation of scar at the site of the
wound repair. Similarly, for gene transfection to be effectively performed, required is a
carrier that exhibits moderate levels of cytotoxicity, able to reversibly rupture the cell
membrane and invasively penetrate the cell prior to releasing a plasmid that will travel to the
nucleus. Then, just as shoveling disturbs the soil but helps seeds be sown deeply into it, so
must drug delivery devices maybe be mildly harmful in order to intrude into the organism
and distribute a benevolent agent to it effectively. Oral drug delivery carriers are thus being
designed so as to reversibly disrupt the tight junction between epithelial cells in the intestine
—an effect otherwise associated with pathological inflammation—so as to enable the
permeation of drugs otherwise large enough to be able to permeate the epithelium per se.40
Years after asbestos was banned from usage, research is done on similarly elongated silicon-
based nanoparticles for the purpose of drug delivery across the epithelium, assuming that
they can be optimized to produce just enough damage to the body to enable an effective
delivery of therapeutic agents.39

Furthermore, it is known that bone is a continuously regenerated organ, but it is less
acknowledged that in order for the cellular regeneration to be triggered, a fracture needs to
occur first. Although the latter mostly appears in form of microscopic cracks, this still shows
the importance of imperfection and fragileness for the sake of preserving regenerative
potentials. Since the inflammation is an integral part of a healthy response of the organism

to implanted foreign material and since most effective drug delivery approaches utilize
vehicles that interfere with the integrity of the targeted tissue to a certain extent (i.e., they
are harmful to just about the right extent), any problematic effect that nanoparticles are
found to exert on the body could be turned into an advantageous one with a little bit of
imagination. This could be directly inferred from the hereby exposed viewpoint that
witnesses the emergence of nanoscience and its applicative findings from the puzzling
peculiarities observed at the nanoscale. For example, some time after it had been found out
that nanoparticles have a tendency to accumulate in the lymph nodes,41 this effect began to
be utilized in preparation of nanoparticle formulations for targeting lymph node dendritic
cells and delivering adjuvants, suspensions of antibodies used to boost immune response,
thereto.42,43 Therefore, just as shelled mollusks form calcium carbonate pearls as a response
to irritating particles of sand and just as binocular creatures turn the binocular disparity from
the cause of disorienting double vision to the source of stereoscopic vision, so could we
expect the future to bring many instances of transformation of the harmful and perplexing
into the remedial and enlightening in the domain of nanoscience.

IT’S ALL IN A PARTICLE: DRUG DELIVERY APPLICATION AS AN
EXAMPLE

As life science and materials science coalesce to an ever greater extent, biomedical
therapeutic techniques are expected to be ever more affected by finely tuned and
controllable drug delivery methods. In that sense, it is worth recalling that the properties of
the particle used for drug delivery largely predetermine the pharmacokinetic efficacy and
potency of the drug. Many hydrophobic drugs that are orally unavailable in their nascent
forms but are easily deliverable when encapsulated within polymeric particles neatly
illustrate that even though one may be in possession of a most pharmaceutically potent
chemical, without the right form of delivery its potency would not be of much use. Another
example of this effect comes from cholesterol.44 Namely, the popularly mistaken dichotomy
of “good” and “bad’ cholesterol refers to an identical chemical structure of cholesterol
molecules, although bound to different cholesterol-transferring lipoprotein complexes in the
bloodstream: high-density ones in case of the “good” and low-density ones in case of the
“bad.” Hence, the “particle” to which cholesterol is bound defines whether it will act as a
beneficial or health-threatening agent.

The following subsections are named after the key properties of particles applied in drug
delivery that should be optimized for a given application in the body.

Aggregation Propensity

Ever since the definition of a nanomaterial as a solid physical structure whose grain size
does not exceed 100 nm along at least one axis was proposed, discussions have been held
among nanoscientists over whether agglomerated nanoparticles can be considered as
nanosystems or not.45 Sometimes such agglomerated powders retain the properties of their
nanoparticulate units. Sometimes, however, they lose the properties of the discrete units and
begin to resemble a highly defective bulk crystal. Whether the former or the latter is the case
greatly depends on the property in question; thus, for example, whereas only mild
agglomeration of magnetic and luminescent nanoparticles, which would have comprised a
superparamagnetic material if sufficiently separated, leads to appearance of unintended
ferro- or ferri-magnetism,46 aggregation of these particulate subunits need not markedly
modify their photoluminescence. And while nanoscientists were busy quarreling over the
purely etymological issue of whether agglomerates of nanosized particles should be
considered as nanosystems or not, eyes have become more and more focused on controllably
and symmetrically aggregated assemblies of nanoparticles, nowadays known as colloidal

delocalization of valence electrons between atomic orbitals of adjacent lattice sites, resulting
in energy drops that exceed the thermal energy of the given atoms by two orders of
magnitude on average, yielding effective properties untraceable to the constituent units
alone, so does organization of nanocrystals within symmetrically ordered superlattices lead
to electronic coupling between nanocrystals that counteracts the quantum confinement,
yielding new and often unexpected properties to the overall system.49 Still, the effect of
controlled aggregation has been utilized to a minor extent only, even though such new ways
to control the aggregation properties of nanoparticles may lead to novel applications in the
field of biomaterials and drug delivery. An example of how controlled aggregation can lead
to sustained released of pharmaceutics comes from the recently utilized method for
preparation of calcium phosphate particles loaded with antibiotics, proteins or small organic
molecules.50 Efficient loading and sustained release of the drug were shown to be
consequential to the drying-induced aggregation of calcium phosphate nanoparticles and
their gradual breaking in the solution, respectively (Figs. 10, 11).

Nanoparticles are increasingly utilized for drug delivery purposes because of multiple
benefits they offer. Firstly, they tend to increase the stability of drugs. A paradigmatic
example is provided by paclitaxel nanoparticles stabilized with Pluronic F68, stable for
years, in contrast with the same drug in dissolved form, undergoing complete degradation in
less than 48 h.51 Secondly, nanoparticles as drug carriers allow for biodistribution of
insoluble drugs and increase of their pharmacokinetic half-life. Thirdly, the degradation of
nanoparticles in the body can be fine-tuned until prolonged release of the drug is reached;
the need for repetitive dosages is thus overcome, enabling more sustained and leveled drug
concentrations in the target area. Aside from the improved stability and sustained therapeutic
release, drug encapsulation within nanoparticles can also enhance bioavailability of drugs
administered via routes other than intravenous (IV). Both insoluble and soluble drugs can
thus be incorporated within nanoparticulate sols and made transferable through blood in
stable form for longer periods of time. Some corrosion-resistant metals form a protective
oxide layer on their surface, and sensitive drug molecules encapsulated within particles often
undergo a similar effect. Even if particles are made of drug only, the molecules on the
surface may undergo degradation when exposed to air or solvent, protecting those in the
interior of the particle. Additionally, drug delivery using fine particles offers the benefits of
tissue-specific targeting via particle functionalization with appropriate moieties.52 This all
explains why nanoparticulate colloids rather than solutions of drugs are often chosen as a
more appropriate delivery form in pharmaceutics.53

Still, there are no perfectly stable colloidal suspensions.54 When the attribute of stability is
ascribed to a sol, it merely means that it takes comparatively long periods of time for the
system to destabilize itself. In other words, aggregation of particulate units of one such
system is sufficiently slow. Hence, although novices in the realm of chemistry often
presume the precipitated powders to preserve their form once the crystal growth is over, that
is quite an incorrect assumption. For, the “dance” of their molecules and incessantly ongoing
phase transformations along the interface occur long after the preparation is over, all the way
through their storage or aging. The same thermodynamic arguments applicable to colloidal
systems can be used with respect to nanoparticles. The large surface area predisposes them
to be unstable; when found in a medium in which a transfer of matter facilely occurs, they
tend to undergo Ostwald ripening and minimize the surface area in contact with the
environment by dissolution of smaller particles and growth of the bigger ones. If we were to
translate the language of thermodynamics to the one of chemistry, we would convert the
interfacial free energy to supersaturation and arrive at the original Ostwald’s observation:
small particles have higher saturation limit than the bigger ones, which creates a
concentration gradient between small and large particles whereby the growth units diffuse

from the higher concentration in the vicinity of small particles to the areas with a lower
concentration around bigger particles.55 Local supersaturation in the solution surrounding
larger particles leads to precipitation of these units on their surface, inducing their growth. In
turn, undersaturated “islands” in the solution simultaneously appear around the surface of
the smaller particles, leading to their further dissolution.

Now, whenever particles are preserved as dry powders, the air surrounding them will not
present a medium that effectively mediates this transfer of matter. In general, the more inert
the medium, the less good of a solvent it is for molecules comprising the particles, and the
greater the barrier for Ostwald ripening will be. However, many applications demand the
particles to be applied in a suspended form, and IV administration of pharmaceutical
nanopowders is an example.56 In those cases, aggregation presents a most critical issue that
leads to undesired modification of the particle properties over time.

The size of nanoparticles furthermore often determines the mechanism of their transport
across the cell membrane and the metabolic fate.57 By knowing that the cellular uptake and
overall response oftentimes depend on the particle size and largely differ for aggregates and
singlets of the same particulate composition,58 controlling particle aggregation clearly
appears as a vital issue. An example is given by 10-nm sized gold nanoparticles designed to
aggregate in mildly acidic intracellular environments through their hydrolysis-susceptible
citraconicamide-functionalized surface.59 After they enter the cell as individual
nanoparticles, they begin to aggregate in endosomes,60 contributing to the destruction of the
targeted cell. Conversely, it was found out that certain nanoparticles can bind to the cell
membrane only insofar as they are aggregated, but can play their intracellular delivery role
only as individual entities.61 Unlike bigger, circa 100-nm sized D-penicillamine-coated
CdSe/ZnS core–shell nanoparticles that were readily internalized by HeLa cells, smaller, 8-
nm sized particles thus merely anchored to the cell membrane and only at higher dosages,
when their clustering became significant and when they were able to trigger endocytosis by
reacting with a sufficient number of receptors, they began to penetrate the cells.62 Local
sedimentation of nanoparticles on the cell membrane is then required to enable cell entry
and perfectly stable colloidal dispersions could thus often turn out to be not so perfect owing
to their promotion of excellent electrostatic repulsion of the individual particles. In those
cases, aggregation state is the favorable one in the extracellular environment, while the
effectiveness of their application may still critically depend on their ability to re-disperse in
the intracellular milieu. Namely, if large enough, particle aggregates are bound to be trapped
in the endocytic vesicles of cells following their internalization, while the endosomal escape
of theirs or of the active transfection agents that they may carry could be limited to
nanosized singlets only.63 A similar case is observed for magnetic nanoparticles for
hyperthermia therapies and other magnetism-based drug delivery applications (Fig. 12).
Namely, these particles can be attracted by an external magnetic field only insofar as they
form aggregates with sufficiently large magnetic moments, while their smart hyperthermic
performance in the target area depends on their superparamagnetism, which is conditioned
by the sufficient spacing between individual nanoparticles.64 Temperature was shown to be
an effective parameter for achieving controllable aggregation/re-dispersion of iron-oxide-
based polymeric micelle-like particles.65 For the purpose of guiding the particles along
relatively wide channels in the body by means of an external field, they could be preserved
in an aggregated form, and then re-dispersed before their entering the cell or other
comparatively small focus area in the body.

Still, agglomeration in formulations of intravenously administrable nanosized powders in
pharmaceutics is considered undesirable from the safety viewpoint and principles of Stokes’
law. As in accordance with the latter, (a) reductions in the particle size, (b) increases in the
medium viscosity and (c) bringing the density of suspended particles and the dispersion

medium closer to each other have been traditionally used to ensure greater stability of many
commercial suspensions, including the pharmaceutical ones.66 Namely, the formation of
particles larger than 5 microns from nanosols is feared to be prone to result in capillary
obstruction and embolism.67 Typically, when it comes to nanosized particles, the addition of
(a) ionic compounds so as to affect the thickness and density of the double charge layer
around the suspended particles, and (b) surfactants so as to promote steric repulsion of the
particles, are basic strategies used to prevent particle agglomeration.68

Whether stabilization of sols using the former, electrostatic or the latter, steric effect
presents a more optimal approach greatly depends on the nature of the solution medium.
Thus, charge stabilization is of little effect in media with low dielectric constant, which
includes most organic solvents, in which cases steric stabilization by the addition of
surfactants or polymers is required to maintain the dispersed state and prevent flocculation.
Furthermore, the amount of surfactant has to be optimized in order to provide the right
conditions for stably dispersing the particles by its means. Namely, too little of it may leave
enough space on the particle surface for particles to approach each other and clump, while
too much of it may exceed the critical micelle concentration, separate the surfactant
molecules from the particle surface or simply reduce their solvation, inducing their collapse
and allowing flocculation to occur, something that the addition of surfactant was meant to
prevent in the first place. The need to optimize the concentration of surfactant to prevent
nanoparticles from irreversibly agglomerating is illustrated in Figure 13. Shown in it are
polylactide-coglycolide spheres encapsulating a vinyl sulfone cysteine proteinase inhibitor,
thoroughly meshed without polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a dispersant (Fig. 13(a)) and at its
concentration of 1 wt% (Fig. 13(c)), and narrowly dispersed at [PVA] = 0.5 wt% (Fig.
13(b)). The outcome of application of surfactants as dispersing agents also often turns out to
be uncontrollable tangling of surfactant molecules when expulsion of the solvent molecules
from the area where the surfactant chains have begun to interlace during particle– particle
collisions is thermodynamically favored. There is no way yet to predict the free energy of
surfactant-medium interaction that is responsible for this effect and the process of finding
the optimal surfactant/medium pairs for a given particle composition and morphology can be
burdensome due to its being based on empirical trial-and-error approach.69 Since
aggregation of nanopowders is difficult to control in a finite time span, more attempts may
be expected to be made in the future with regard to controllable aggregation and re-
dispersion of particles.

Differently sized particles have routinely been shown to produce different effects when
applied as drug delivery agents.70–72 For example, if intravenously deliverable magnetic
particles guidable by means of an external magnetic field are too small, their magnetic
moments might be negligible and they would be uncontrollably carried away by the
bloodstream. If they are too big, on the other hand, they might not be capable of
maneuvering effectively across the blood vessels and the intercellular space. For this reason,
it is often stated that different targets in the body require differently sized particles for the
most optimal penetration and drug delivery. In support of this, invoked could be the fact that
different cell types find differently sized topographic clues of otherwise chemically identical
compounds most optimal for their attachment and growth. For example, while mesenchymal
stem cells thrive best on arrays of TiO2 nanotubes with diameters of less than 30 nm,73 the
metabolic activity of osteoblasts is highest when the diameter of said nanotubes is larger
than 30 nm.74 Then, MC3T3-E1 fibroblasts found polymeric substrates with high contents
of alginate most optimal for their spreading and proliferation, whereas L929 fibroblasts grew
best on those with low alginate contents.75 On a side note, cytotoxicity of certain materials
has been shown to be greatly dependent on the cell type. For example, silver nanoparticles

were more toxic to macrophages than to lung epithelial cells,76 while cobalt-doped
hydroxyapatite was toxic to osteoblastic cells and nontoxic to cells of the intestinal
epithelium.77 Moreover, biodistribution profiles of certain types of particles are known to
sometimes undergo a sharp change in the range of 1–5 nm, while any bigger particles, be
they of nano- or micro-sized nature, show highly similar accumulation in vital organs.78

The size distribution is also a crucial parameter and a special emphasis is placed on
monodisperse particles (PDI < 0.1). One reason is that uniform sizes tend to result in
uniform properties. The issues of inconsistent dosing consequently often result due to wide
distribution of particle sizes (PDI > 0.5), an effect that also favors Ostwald ripening and
destabilization of dispersions. Because Ostwald ripening is caused by the difference in
solubility limit for small and large particles, the propensity of the system for it is inversely
proportional to the narrowness of the particle size distribution. Hence, a rule of the thumb
says that the more uniform the particles, the greater their stability with respect to Ostwald
ripening. For the same reason, monodisperse nanopowders are preferred over polydisperse
ones as precursors for the sintering of nonporous materials.79 To prevent the grain growth
and retain the nanoparticulate nature of the material, two-step annealing is typically
performed in those cases:80,81 the short one at higher temperatures, at which pores become
thermodynamically unstable against shrinkage, so as to block the grain boundary migration,
and then the prolonged one at lower temperatures to reduce the pores without grain
growth.82

On the other hand, living organisms are far-fromequilibrium systems, which may suggest
that tailoring the structure, properties and functionality of materials that are meant to be
interfaced with them should follow the route of greater reliance on similarly metastable
nanoscale architectures. In that sense, examples of successful usage of various multimodal
particle or pore size distributions could be mentioned. One of them pertains to
hydroxyapatite cylinders shown to possess higher drug release rates and bone ingrowth
potential when pore size distribution in them was bimodal rather than monodisperse.83 Also,
polydisperse, not monodisperse particles were those that, following a long series of attempts,
successfully self-assembled into virus-like superlattices.84 Likewise, randomly patterned
PMMA substrates, without any osteogenic supplements, were shown to be effective in
inducing differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts, unlike the chemically
identical substrates with a perfect translational symmetry,85 suggesting that too much order
in the cellular environment can be detrimental for the cell growth. In fact, when it comes to
fabrication of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, combination of (a) larger pores that are
to home osteoblasts and (b) smaller pores through which nutrients and metabolites would
transverse presents a better choice compared to scaffolds composed of uniformly distributed
pores of equal dimensions.86 After all, since biological systems are all about an entwinement
of symmetry and asymmetry, perfection and imperfection, replicating such blends rather
than focusing solely on perfect symmetries achievable presents a task whose
accomplishment will bring great benefits to future materials scientists and engineers. To
understand that diversification rather than fosterage of monotonous sameness is the path to
be followed is a vital challenge to both experimentalists who unquestionably overvalue
structural symmetries and science authorities that erroneously deem the uniformity of
opinions and methodologies to be a merit and not a sign of a dead end in the progression of
our creativity.

In general, by controlling the shape of the particles, their contact surface could be tailored
for a given application. Hence, for particles meant to have a high retention time in the
bloodstream, spherical morphologies, having the lowest contact surface, would be the
natural choice. In contrast, elongated, planar particles would present a logical choice for

drug delivery carriers intended to adhere onto biological surfaces. Irregularly shaped, quasi-
planar particles were thus shown to act as more effective drug carriers for delivery across the
epithelium, owing to their larger surface area in contact with the epithelial layer of cells and,
consequently, more efficient adherence thereto.87 Implicitly, these results challenge the
widespread contemporary acceptance of the direct correlativity between the level of
morphological symmetry of nano- and microparticles and their scientific appeal. This
instance of more effective performance of asymmetric particles than their narrowly
dispersed, spherical counterparts presents an excellent occasion for the correctness of the
common beliefs that sphericity and symmetry directly translate to utility in the design of
micro- and nanoparticles for biomedical or any other applications to be brought into
question.

Highly irregular, plate-shaped and cylindroid particles were also shown to adhere to tumor
vasculature and be sequestered by the liver, spleen and lung to a much greater extent than
spherical particles did.88 On the other hand, although a spherical particle has to be smaller
than 200 nm in diameter to bypass the asymmetric filtering units in spleen, so-called slits,
disk-shaped red blood cells with diameters of about 10 microns easily pass through it,89
indicating that not only size of the particle, but its shape as well as stiffness are equally
important properties thereof. Shape and texture of the particles can thus be optimized to
promote adhesion by means of simple steric effects, and an additional example comes from
the synthesis of silica beads with silicon nanowires outgrown from their surface (Fig. 14).
These composite particles effectively adhered to microvilli of the epithelial cells of the
gastrointestinal tract,90,91 prolonging the drug retention time and promoting the paracellular
transport of small and medium sized drug molecules across the epithelium (Fig. 15).39

As of recently, gold nanorods have also been favored over gold nanospheres, owing to the
fact that the former exhibit a larger plasmon shift per refractive index unit and thus a greater
sensitivity to changes in local environments.92 At the same time, the degree of cellular
internalization of gold nanoparticles was shown to be directly proportional to their aspect
ratio.93 Elongated particles also favor surface appearance of particular crystal faces, the
slowest growing ones, which can have a tremendous effect on the interfacial energy and
binding chemistry, as can be exemplified by the morphological modifications of Pt particles
so that either hydrophobic (533) faces or wetted (553) ones, ostensibly similar in geometry,
are exposed on the surface.94 Surface patterning has thus been applied to promote desired
hydrophilicity and optimal peptide and cell adherence, demonstrating how morphology of a
material can decisively affect its chemical interactivity.95 On the other hand, planar particles
have a greater tendency to aggregate on blood vessel walls and block vital passageways, as
exemplified by the typically plate- or needle-shaped cholesterol and apatite crystals that
comprise atherosclerotic deposits.96 To avoid such asbestos-like apoptotic effects related to
high aspect ratio morphologies,97,98 it is vital to carry out toxicity studies prior to biological
application of such materials or show their solubility in relatively short periods of time, as is
the case with silicon nanowires shown in Figure 14 or maghemite nanowires usable for cell
manipulation and microrheology.99

Crystallinity

Kinetics of the formation of nanopowders, be it via precipitation or by top-down deposition
and assembly, affects their crystallinity. In cases when the drug release is contingent upon
the dissolution of the particles encapsulating it, their crystallinity can dramatically affect the
drug elution profiles. One example could be found in calcium phosphate particles whose
stoichiometry, that is, phase composition was used to tune their dissolution behavior and,
hence, the release kinetics of small organic molecules, antibiotics and large polypeptides,
e.g., bovine serum albumin, that the particles were loaded with by means of
physisorption.100 As shown in Figure 16, the drug elution rate, directly proportionate to the

solubility rate of the compound, is markedly higher for amorphous calcium phosphate than
for its nanocrystalline phase, hydroxyapatite, with the crystallite size of 12 nm.

In general, the dissolution of amorphous or less crystalline polymorphs is entropically
favored over more crystalline phases with an identical stoichiometry. In this case, again, the
distribution of crystallinity throughout the sample greatly matters. Namely, a minor amount
of a crystalline phase in an amorphous sample is sometimes enough to induce the transition
of the amorphous phase to a more stable, crystalline one. Just like Ostwald ripening is
enhanced at wide size distributions, so do broad distributions in crystallinity favor the
transition of an amorphous material to crystalline state. Owing to greater structural similarity
of amorphous particles to the solution from which they were precipitated, the free energy of
their formation is lower compared to that of well structured, crystalline particles.101 With
the free energy relatable to supersaturation ratio, this translates to greater solubility limit for
amorphous particles, as opposed to their crystalline counterparts, resulting in a similar
gradient of concentration as that consequential to Ostwald ripening, and leading to
dissolution of the amorphous phase and recrystallization of its atomic ingredients on the
surface of the crystalline phase. Introducing a crystal into a sol composed of solely
amorphous particles can thus sometimes induce a rapid transition of the particles into a more
crystalline state. Surfactants, viscosity enhancers, ionic strength modifiers, the choice of
dispersion media, sol density and temperature can all be used to somewhat control the
crystallinity of the powders and its evolution in the course of aging following the synthesis
step.

Drug Release Profiles

Achieving constant rates of delivery by means of slowly degrading and drug-releasing
carriers implanted in the body is often presented as an ideal alternative to the traditional drug
therapies based on repetitive administration and consequently inconsistent ups-and-downs in
concentration of the active ingredient in the target area (Fig. 17(a)); however, more complex
and specially designed concentration gradients of the released drug are expected to result
from the future research in this field. Although burst releases have been traditionally
considered as undesirable in the drug delivery field, sometimes there are clear advantages of
theirs, as in the cases when drugs are antibiotics administered so as to eradicate a microbial
source of infection. Namely, as shown in Figure 17(b), the ability of the carrier to release the
drug in the amount that exceeds the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the given
combination of the antibiotic and the pathological agent is crucial in prevention of the rise of
resistance of the bacterial population to the administered antibiotic.

Multiple-stage release profiles can be considered to hold potentially far greater benefits
compared to monotonous drug elution kinetics. For example, the rapid initial release of
paclitaxel from polymeric microparticles was effective in halting proliferation of ovarian
cancer cells, while its more sustained, second phase of release allowed for gradual
eradication of the tumor.102 The drug release profile considered desirable in targeting
diseases that involve pain or hormonal disorders is a pulsating one, whereby periods of
instantaneous release are followed by periods of minimal or no release, an effect that could
be potentially achieved either by (a) making the carrier sensitive to environmental stimuli,
be it pH,103 the presence of a disease marker,104 temperature,105,106 ultrasound107 or
external electromagnetic fields,108,109 or by (b) the design of multishell particles, such as the
triple-shell calcium-phosphate-DNA nanoparticles, for example.110

In that sense, there can be no perfect drug release carrier, but only a perfect carrier for a
given target area and pathology in the body. Not a single quality could be assessed nor
defined without reference to both the system and its overall environment;111 consequently,
no two drug delivery treatments should be the same. The ideal release properties depend on:

(a) the drug that is to be delivered; (b) the nature of the illness treated for; and (c) the
targeted area in the body. For example, some antibiotics, such as beta-lactam antimicrobials,
are time-dependent, while others, including quinolones and amino-glycosides, are
concentration-dependent (Fig. 17(b)).112 As for the nature of the pathology treated,
suppression of cancer requires high therapeutic specificity, unlike bacterial or fungal
infections. Cancer cells are notorious for developing resistance to drugs; therefore, prompter
and more potent treatments are required when conceiving cancer chemotherapies. The target
is then also ideally not only the cancer cell per se but the surrounding niche too, which may
be healthy but is still producing growth factors to support the cancer cells.113 Unlike cancer,
which is more pervasive and harder to eliminate, osteomyelitis tends to be more localized
and spread with a well outlined front, with white blood cells clearly bordering the area of
infection (Fig. 17(c)).

Another example comes from the fact that the expression of osteogenic markers suggestive
of bone formation greatly depends not only on the biomaterial used to augment the
osteogenic response, but on the cell type and their immediate environment; thus, the same
calcium phosphate materials were shown to induce only osteoconductive behavior of
adherent MC3T3-E1114 fibroblasts, the pre-myogenic C2C12 cell line115 and SaOS-2
cells,116 and markedly increased levels of osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal
stem cells.117 Materials with strong anticancer properties may thus be expected to have a
more suppressive or less metabolically augmentative effect on immortal cell lines than on
stem-cell-derived or primary cells of the same type. The concept of intrinsic osteoinduc-
tivity of specific calcium phosphate ceramics, meant to be definable with no reference to
cellular types and milieus, can be therefore seen as fundamentally deficient.118,119
Moreover, infections in the hardly approachable interior of bone and on the surface of teeth
are quite different and, logically, call for different types of drug delivery. Finally,
vascularization and other features of the target tissue largely predetermine the optimal drug
release profiles, often dependent on the clearance period for the given particles. In that
sense, it does make a difference whether particles are being injected to cancellous (i.e.,
trabecular/spongy) bone, the most vascular hard tissue, or to less vascular cortical bone or
even one of hard tissues in teeth, such as enamel that is deprived of any vascularization at
all120 (Fig. 17(d)). The delivery carrier and the target area in the body are thus entwined
within a feedback loop so that the former defines the scope of its potential application in the
latter, while the latter calls for specific particle properties to be effectively treated.

Biocompatibility

As we see, the quality of a material applied to restore damaged tissues could not be defined
without referring both to the area of its application in the body and the finest characteristics
of the material. Differently sized particles would be required for drug-delivery treatments of
different tissues,123 whereby different mechanical and chemical properties of the biomaterial
are employed to tackle pathologies occurring at different scales. Finally, an essential feature
of a biomaterial, defined as “a material intended to interface with biological systems to
evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function in the body,” 124 is its
biocompatibility, which could not be measured without an interaction with the patient. Even
though it is known that pathological states of an organism need to be explained in terms of
both the effect of foreign factors and the susceptibility of the host organism, it is still
puzzling why a specific material becomes refused by one and accepted by other patients,
serving as a reminder of the subjective nature of every medical treatment. Needless to say,
the effective application of each biomaterial critically depends on a favorable feedback
interaction between the living system and the material, during which both are most often
subject to change. A perfect hard tissue substitute is, thus, meant to be thoroughly absorbed

as an unattained ideal.

Biodegradability

Certain drug delivery agents possess artificial reservoirs from which the drug is released to
the physiological environment125 or have the drug entrapped in surface pores;126 in those
cases, degradability is in no way related to the drug release kinetics and the implanted
material often has to be surgically removed at the end of its therapeutic lifetime. On the
other side of the spectrum are particles that release encapsulated drugs only inasmuch as
their structure degrades.127–130 It goes without saying that degradation properties of the
material in question should be carefully analyzed so as to avoid their potentially toxic effect
on the body. Some molecules, such as CTAB, are, for example, biologically inert when they
are surface-bound; detached from the particle, they become highly cytotoxic.131 As science
of nutrition can teach us132 and propositions of holism confirm,133 it is the synergy of
different chemical components that is responsible for the effect each one of them
individually will have on the organism.

In the same light, we could conclude that all the variables in a physical system are tightly
interconnected, and each one of the abovementioned parameters can be shown to depend on
all the other ones. Moreover, most of these effects stand in an antagonistic relationship with
each other; that is, modifying the synthesis conditions in the direction of promoting one set
of desired properties most often has an unfavorable effect on other product properties. For
example, formation of complex particle morphologies, e.g., platelets, star-shaped or
uniaxially grown crystals, is conditioned by (a) a comparatively slow attainment of the
metastable state from which the phase transition would occur, and (b) a slow corresponding
crystal growth. In turn, this tardiness tends to have a detrimental effect on the particle size,
provided one seeks to stay in the nanosized range. Namely, low nucleation rate that results
under these conditions directly translates to low density of crystallization centers and,
consequently, bigger particles. Conversely, the immediate downside of the mainstream
methods for fabrication of ultrafine particles is the low level of control of particle
morphology. By controlling the latter, however, many of the mentioned properties of
biomedical relevance could be tuned. Drug release profiles thus often depend on the texture
of the material; e.g., when drug molecules are stored in pores whose size is bigger than the
molecular size, the drug is expected to be released by diffusion, whereas when the pore size
is comparable to that of the drug molecules, zero order rate of release, constant over time,
may be observed.134 Materials with rougher surfaces may also attract anchoring cells to
them quicker than smooth materials can, which speeds up their degradation in the body and,
hence, the drug release. Small molecules too tend to be best adsorbed on rough surfaces, as
could be demonstrated by the absence of adsorption of carbon monoxide on atomically
smooth gold.135 Titanium implants with naturally smooth surfaces have thus been shown as
ineffective in binding cells; to prevent their rejection by the body, they are either coated with
a more bio-compatible layer or subjected to sandblasting and etching procedures prior to
their application in vivo.136 The necessity for a biomaterial to possess a rough surface, for
only as such can the conditions for an optimal cell attachment be achieved, brings us over to
the general question that pertains to intrinsic imperfections that all biomaterials are to ideally
exhibit. Note that the same argument applies to adsorption of small molecules; namely, as it
could be expected from the fact that most adsorption mechanisms are driven by the Gibbs
isotherm, which dictates that the greater the surface energy, the greater the adsorption,
hydrogen adsorption capacity becomes markedly enhanced as one shifts from using
perfectly ordered carbon crystals on the atomic scale to those containing topological
defects.137

One of the crucial questions that the materials science applications in biomedicine will need
to answer is how to define the optimal imperfections that each material applicable in
biological systems, each one of which could be defined as a system composed of “unreliable
components that achieve reliable outcomes,” 138 is to possess. Namely, in medicine of
restorative hard tissues, for many years it has been considered that the stronger the material
used as an in vivo substitute for the damaged tissue, the better. However, applying metals as
substitutes for the damaged bone turned out to be unfavorable exactly because of their
superior mechanical properties. Once implanted in the body, metals would absorb most of
the mechanical stimuli that the surrounding tissue is subjected to and just as one’s living in a
perfectly sterile environment slowly puts one’s immune system to sleep and makes one less
resilient to intruding species, this stress-shielding effect caused the surrounding bone to
become weaker and eventually completely resorbed, leading to the collapse of the local
biomechanical structure.139 Similarly, if a biomaterial with identical elastic properties as
natural bone is applied, the implanted cells would not do any work to “instill life” therein;
eventually the probability for its rejection by the body would be high. Therefore, a
biomaterial has to remain somewhat imperfect in order for the host cells to create a milieu
capable of cell proliferation, tissue re-growth and full integration of the bioresorbable
material. When the aforementioned titanium implants are subjected to etching to endow
them with surface roughness, the processing makes them seemingly less perfect at the first
sight, although it provides a more optimal integration with the organism in the long run.
Likewise, since it is known that most cells prefer stiff surfaces to grow on,140,141 one may
be allured to seed them on plastics, stiffer than glass; under those conditions, however, they
would often tend to adhere intensely indeed, but only owing to pathological disruption of the
spindle morphology, which interferes with the cell replication cycles and metabolic
pathways and suppresses the natural cell response to stimuli. How to be imperfectly perfect
is one of the vital questions that the mindsets and methods of materials scientists need to
embrace in their search for ever greater bridging of the gaps that separate them from the life
science coast of knowledge.

INCREASING EXPERIMENTATION SENSITIVITY

As we continue to chart the nano realm, the windows within which the optimal conditions
for fabrication of nanostructures with desired properties are found will become narrower and
narrower, resulting in ever greater bodies of irreproducible results and, therefore, a greater
level of frustration among the experimentalists, including, quite possibly, an exacerbation of
the trend toward culling and filtering of experimental data that already assumes epidemic
proportions.142 My earlier works contained more in-breadth discourses on the limits in
precision with which we will be able to control physical processes as we keep on proceeding
along the line of the constant increase in the fineness of scientific manipulation of material
structures.143 Imperfectly repeatable synthesis protocols, producing large variations of the
resulting material properties, will be particularly critical for products which cannot be tested
and potentially discarded prior to application, as is the case with drug delivery implants or
other therapeutic nanodevices. On the characterization side, one of the first signs that critical
limits in our capacity to control the physical processes on the ultrafine scale have been
reached will have come from an inability to decouple the effects of the measurement
systems on the qualities of the measured systems from their qualities per se. For example,
during a recent ultrastructural characterization of graphene, it was impossible to tell whether
the detected moving of a line of point defects was naturally occurring or it was due to the
conversion of the electron beam energy to the thermal lattice movement.144 Similarly,
widely dispersed, irregular and flat PbS nanoparticles—relatively robust to start with—were
seen transforming to uniform spherical particles after 11 min of residing under the TEM
beam,145 yielding a dramatic example of the fact well known from the basic tenet of the

theory of measurements: both the observer and the observed are involved in defining the
observed system’s qualities.

On the synthesis side, the first crucial signs of reaching these limits will be associated with
persistently and pervasively irreproducible experimental outcomes. This could be compared
to magnifying any imaginable signal up to the level when we start discerning merely
fluctuations describable as white noise. Yet, an incessant challenge is to establish methods to
convert this apparent randomness into more sophisticated signals. Dynamic light scattering
methods for probing the diffusion and size properties of colloidal systems were, for
example, designed to extract meaningful information from the seemingly random, Brownian
motion, reminding us that everything that appears random could be actually seen as ordered
and governed by certain laws when understood on a sufficiently small scale. Whether we
have the effect of air bubbles in water146 (which have been invoked as the reason why
attempts to confirm one such simple yet fundamental phenomenon such as Mpemba effect,
depicted in Figure 18, have failed147), seasonal atmospheric variations, stirring rates148–150
or the Earth’s magnetic field,151,152 these minor effects will be increasingly paid attention
to. The reaction volume is, for example, now already established as a crucial parameter of a
synthesis procedure. Many attempts to scale-up a preparation procedure for its transfer from
the lab bench to industry have failed exactly owing to the sensitivity of the given process to
the reaction vessel size and oftentimes geometry and chemical composition of its walls as
well.153,154 Overly tall reaction volumes, for example, increased the probability of
precipitation of aragonite or vaterite—the two of the less stable CaCO3 phases—from a
solution in the presence of an organic matrix, while flattened volumes were more prone to
yield calcite, the most thermodynamically stable and the least soluble of CaCO3 phases.155
Recently it was demonstrated that osteoblasts cultured in star-shaped microwells
differentiated to a significantly higher degree compared to the cells cultured in the
microwells of pentagonal or square geometries,156 while the mechanoreciprocity principle
dictates that there is a direct correspondence between the mechanical cues of the
environment and cytoskeletal forces on which many signaling pathways within the cell and
its phenotype crucially depend.157 Not a single reaction system is, after all, perfectly isolated
from its environment and quite often it is the interface between the system and its
environment (that is, a reaction and its container) that presents a crucial factor that drives the
reaction towards its desired outcome. The only place where a liquid reaction system could
exist virtually free from an interface with a physical environment would be in vacuum, the
conditions under which the liquid would, however, swiftly evaporate.

One example of the effect of reaction volume comes from the recently proposed
evolutionary tree of the morphology of gold nanorods prepared by hydrolysis of HAuCl4 in
the presence of CTAB at mild to highly acidic pHs.158 It was found out that shifting only the
reaction volume from 0.9 to 45 ml changed the size and aspect ratio of gold nanoparticles by
more than a single order of magnitude. Reaction systems that are subject to heating tend to
be particularly sensitive to variations in volume, due to gradations in the heat flux. The
purity of common reaction systems also presents a critical parameter of synthesis; as shown
in Figure 19, introducing seemingly negligible amounts of impurities sometimes results in
drastic changes in morphology and other properties of the material. Typical distilled water,
the epitome of purity in the lab, contains a few solutes at c > 0.01 mM (a few ppm), a few
dozens of solutes at c > 1 nM, and hundreds of solutes at c > 10 pM,159 alongside dissolved
air and other gases (circa 5 mM) collected during aging under atmospheric conditions. These
gaseous impurities are expected to exert critical influences on reaction pathways, as many
reactions are now known to be catalyzed by the dissolved gas,160 as well as that its presence
can be comparable to defects in a solid body.161 Furthermore, from the particle growth
kinetics standpoint, a tradeoff naturally exists: the slower the process, the greater the level of
the control of fabricated properties, but at the same time the greater the chance that the

internal or external impurities will be introduced that will drive the reaction in an undesired
direction and prevent its repeatability. In general, as the fineness of the chemical reactions
and physicochemical processes increases and as windows of conditions that lead to desirable
products are narrowed, impurities previously disregarded will have to be taken into account.
The effects of impurities in as minor concentrations as in the aforementioned picomolar
range will thus prove as increasingly important in attaining ideals of sophisticated sensitivity
and precise localizations of ultrafine physicochemical processes.

Then, as biomolecules will become increasingly utilized in fabrication of ultrafine
structures, sensitivity of their folding and assembly into proper configurations will introduce
uncontrollable energy landscapes into the game. For example, single post-translational
modifications can drastically change the protein functionality,162 while recombinant proteins
may occasionally exhibit completely different properties compared to their native
counterparts despite having identical primary structures, which is often caused by different
folding.163 Elimination of a disulfide bond in dodecapeptides isolated by phage or cell
surface display systems has thus been shown to induce a 3-fold increase in the size of
calcium phosphate particles precipitated in the presence of these peptides.164 Many of these
effects have been so regularly neglected in the lab practice that questioning them, even
though it is well justified from the point of view of experimental rigorousness, might be seen
as malevolent interference with the bench work. One example comes from the insufficiently
investigated effects of fluorescent tags. Cells have been, for example, shown to react
significantly differently when a fluorescent molecule such as FITC, used merely to visualize
it in immunohistochemical analyses, is tagged onto the analyzed macromolecule or particle
in question.165 The effects of the cell circadian rhythm on nanoparticle-cell interactions are
also still largely unexplored, even though it is known that the expression of almost 50% of
genes in certain cell types shows variations depending on it.166 Another example may come
from the often ignored effect buffers exert on the reactions run in their presence. That
buffers can drastically affect the experimental outcomes can be illustrated by precipitation
reactions whose products were modified with respect to phase composition or polymorphic
identity depending on the nature of the buffer. For example, whether organic Tris or
inorganic phosphates are used as buffers can lead to precipitation of thoroughly different
calcium phosphate phases.167 This is partly a consequence of the ability of Tris and
particularly Bis-Tris to sequester free calcium ions from the solution and form metallo-
organic complexes, the effect that was both theoretically predicted168 and experimentally
confirmed.169 Whether one precipitates calcium phosphates from simulated body fluid,
normally buffered using Tris/Bis-Tris, or from phosphate buffer saline or a non-buffered
aqueous solution, can thus have a drastic effect on the nature of the precipitated phase.170
Also, since Tris has been shown to exhibit a toxic effect in mammalian cell cultures,171–173
the biological response to solids formed in the presence of Tris can also significantly differ
from that observed for materials precipitated in the presence of a different buffer.

That seemingly minor changes in atmosphere can have a crucial effect on some of the most
routine phase transformations induced at high annealing temperatures is demonstrated by the
proposed seasonal variation in humidity as a factor that obstructed the degradation of
hydroxyapatite upon heating and limited the reproducibility of its calcinations.174 Then,
although routine errors of pH measurements typically prevent experimentalists to report
values precise to the second decimal digit, pH variations on exactly the second decimal digit
during a preparation of zinc oxide led to significant changes in the morphology and
photoluminescent spectra of the particles.175 Thus we arrive once more at the crucial
challenge in attempts to further our ability to control physicochemical transformations at the
nanoscale: when will the limits in experimental sensitivity be reached and what will we do
then?

CRISSCROSSING THEORY AND EXPERIMENTS

Most materials scientists would readily describe their expertise as falling in the realm of
either theoretical or experimental knowledge, but not both. Although the term “tunable” has
been extensively used to describe size-dependent material properties, strictly speaking it
cannot be associated with the attribute “designable” since the connections between lab
notebook blueprints and the final experimental outcomes in terms of desirable material
properties are not readily establishable. Although it has ever since been the dream of
materials scientists to devise a perfectly precise algorithm that connects synthesis
parameters, material structure and properties, its function and performance, it is still
permeated with numerous missing links. For example, although quantum dots do exhibit
size-dependent optoelectronic properties, Fermi levels of quantum dots can still not be
designed prior to fabricating them. Only after the material is prepared and characterized for
its properties, one would go back and mark the experimental conditions that have yielded the
desired properties as worth reporting or passing on to further stages in the chain of
technological development (Fig. 20). However, the synthesis method sometimes modifies
material properties far beyond those predictable from their chemical nature. A tricalcium
phosphate ceramic obtained in a mechanochemical-hydrothermal process thus paradoxically
exhibited greater resistance to degradation than hydroxyapatite, demonstrating that the
synthesis method and the structural features it produces may have a more decisive effect on
the powder properties than its bare chemical composition.176 That experimental settings can
counter-intuitively lead to surprising properties has been also evidenced by the case wherein
the capacity of magnesium to absorb hydrogen doubled upon the addition of 50 wt% of fully
inert, hydrogen-saturated titanium hydrate to it, owing to the nucleation-promoting effect of
the latter, showing how sometimes an intentional introduction of impurities or functionless
components in order to make the material less pure and perfect results in its greater
reactivity and an intriguing functional upgrade.177 A similar example comes from the field
of mixed zinc ferrites:178 namely, with the addition of diamagnetic Zn2+ to nickel ferrite
lattice, comprising magnetic Ni2+ and Fe3+, the magnetic moment of the compound
increases and reaches a maximum at approximately 1:1 molar ratio of zinc-to-nickel.179 This
peculiar effect is explained by the ability of Zn2+ ions to replace Fe3+ ions from the
tetrahedral, A sites of the inverse spinel structure of NiFe2O4 and thus diminish the
compensation of the superexchange, antifer-romagnetic coupling of the magnetic moments
of Fe3+ ions positioned on the A sites and Fe3+ and Ni2+ ions resting on the octahedral, B
sites of the crystal lattice.180

The same observation applies to the field of drug discovery, where despite the extensive
initial screening steps, the final candidates for a drug undergo randomized, trial-and-error
studies in vitro, on animals and then on humans, eventually unexplainably failing or living
up to their promises, or even yielding an unforeseen therapeutic effect. Sildenafil citrate,
a.k.a. Viagra, which had been designed to be a hypertension-relieving drug, but failed in that
and was only later associated with the side effects for which it is currently demanded on the
market, offers a particularly popular example. As pointed out by Arthur Kornberg,
“Discoveries are commonly serendipitous. The best plan over many decades has been no
plan.”181 Moreover, the Nobel Laureate went on to claim that “medical research is still more
a game of pool than billiards; you score points regardless of which pocket the ball goes
into,” quoting the example of Harold Varmus who received the Nobel Prize in 1989 together
with Michael Bishop for their studies on breast cancer, despite the fact that “actually,
Varmus’ studies yielded no insights into human breast cancer, but they did provide an
important advance in understanding brain development. At the same time, a research
program headed by Robert Weinberg at MIT, directed toward a rat brain tumor, did make a
major contribution to understanding human breast cancer. Of the several genes now known
to be involved in human breast cancer, all but one were discovered by researchers working

on something other than breast cancer.” For example, after 80% of patients with glaucoma
had unexpectedly experienced growth and thickening of eyelashes upon applying
bimatoprost, a drug used to treat glaucoma, the FDA decided to approve the drug as a
pharmaceutical product for eyelash growth.182 In fact, the discovery of most other chemicals
in contemporary usage, from cisplatin to Teflon to polio vaccine and penicillin, is owed to
relentless and serendipitous trial-and-error methodology rather than to well-planned assault
on particular research targets.183,184

Reinforcing links between the theory and the experiment, in all contexts of nanoscience,
from particle syntheses to the design of nanoscale drug delivery platforms, would bring us
closer to the ideal of predicting experimental outcomes with a greater certainty. And with
our ability to estimate the material properties based on the known experimental settings of
synthesis, the first chain in the “nano” train depicted in Figure 20 will be made much
stronger and stable than it is today.

CONJOINING TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP SYNTHETIC APPROACHES

Many subfields of materials science have traditionally relied on classical, top-down ways of
synthesizing new materials. During the last decade or so, most of those have, however,
undergone the trend of adoption of soft and more elegant, colloidal chemistry approaches, as
opposed to the robust top-down methods.185 However, whereas the former may be said to
exhibit drawbacks associated with the lack of facileness to process the self-assembled
systems into technologically functional units, the main downside of the latter is the lack of
ability to simultaneously organize a multitude of entities in a time- and cost-effective
manner. Still, by applying these two mainstream synthetic approaches in parallel, so that
they complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, there is a chance that more
superior bases for fabrication of new materials will be established. Top-down controllability
would play a role in component integration stages, while soft, simple and inexpensive
methods often replicable on a kitchen stove would render materials science know-how easily
transferable from hi-tech hot spots to countries at the technological standstill, able to
scientifically contribute to bridging the gap between rich and poor, on which sustainability
of the world as we know it pivotally depends.186,187 In an effort to build such synergetic
instrumentation, the techniques for (a) controlled, lithographic deposition and (b)
spontaneous growth and assembly have been combined, enabling facile fabrication of
different nanoscale symmetries via varying the ratio between the deposition flux and the
diffusion rate.188 An overall impression is thus that the most effective routes for fabrication
of functional nanostructures in the future will greatly depend on the ability of
experimentalists to utilize top-down and bottom-up techniques in tandem.189

UNDERSTANDING A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS THAT CO-DEFINE THE
EXPERIMENTATION OUTCOMES

The boundary that separates the potentials of these two synthetic approaches was summed
up nicely by the thought of Richard Smalley: “Much like you can’t make a boy and a girl
fall in love with each other simply by pushing them together, you cannot make precise
chemistry occur as desired between two molecular objects with simple mechanical motion
along a few degrees of freedom. Chemistry, like love, is more subtle than that. You need to
guide the reactants down a particular reaction coordinate, and this coordinate treads through
a many-dimensional hyperspace… Near the center of the typical chemical reaction, the
particular atoms that are going to form the new bonds are not the only ones that jiggle
around: so do all the atoms they are connected to and the ones connected to these in turn. All
these atoms must move in a precise way to ensure that the result of the reaction is the one
intended.”190,191 These words shed light on the contextual nature of all chemical

phenomena, an effect unknowingly utilized by practically any scientist in search for the right
conditions that would yield a desired product. Examples of this effect that implicitly
underlies the all-pervading holistic nature of physical phenomena are countless, ranging
from modifications of functionality of cells autogenically transplanted from one tissue to
another to oncogenes causing cancer or not depending on whether they are inserted into
grown animal cells or embryos192 to pancreatic cells able to release insulin only when
forming islets of specific sizes,193,194 neither too big nor too small.

As an extension of this effect, the hypothesis was outlined stating that each self-assembly
process is, strictly speaking, a co-assembly since the spontaneous reorganization of a system
may take place only in parallel with a well coordinated reorganization of its immediate
environment.195 Such a perspective where qualities of a system are inextricably related to
the state of its environment has been established in agreement with the previously proposed
co-creational thesis and its cognitive and epistemological connotations.196,197 The idea of
co-assembly was supported by studies on reverse micelles198 where it was noticed that these
molecular aggregates do not act as passive templates for the formation of nanocrystals
within their cores, but undergo mutual transformations with the nucleating phase.199 Hence,
different compounds may be synthesized by following the same preparation procedure,
depending on whether reverse micelles are present in the reaction system or not. They also
play an active role in catalyzing the transformations between intermediaries which may have
a crucial effect on the final products of precipitation reactions and other phase transitions
that take place in their presence.200 Also, as shown in Figure 21(a)–(b), folding of proteins
in reverse micelles is greatly affected by the space limitation effect, demonstrating the extent
to which the physical environment affects the structure and, therefore, the function of these
basic biomolecular units. Figure 21(c)–(d) concordantly show that even the structure of
water inside of reverse micelles is different from the bulk water and subject to change
depending on the size of the micelle. Similarly, whoever has designed an experiment to
assess the controlled release rate of a molecule encapsulated within a nanocarrier must have
become familiar with how modifications of the parameters that define the environment into
which the eluted drug molecules will diffuse, including its volume, temperature, agitation
level, salt content, frequency of replenishment, etc., can be used to tune the release kinetics
profiles to a desired one. Figure 22(a) correspondingly shows a hypothetic example of an
identical drug delivery device yielding two kinetically distinct release profiles depending on
the release measurement methodology applied: zero-order upon daily replacements of a
comparatively small volume of the solvent and first-order one upon the usage of larger
solvent volume and no daily replenishments thereof. Namely, whereas the drug is released in
burst fashion when a sufficient volume of the solvent is provided, limited amounts of the
solvent place a cap on the maximal amount that could be released before the saturation is
reached, leaving space for the eventual fabrication of a desired release profile. None of these
two methods, however, mimic the biological conditions under which fast clearance of the
released drug is typically observed, nor they account for the effects of the complex interface
between the device and numerous macromolecules and cells of the host organism on drug
release. And today we know that although size, shape and elasticity of nanoparticles in
biological milieus do influence their biodistribution profiles, the route of uptake and the
mechanism of interaction with the cell are mainly determined by the protein corona
adsorbed on the particles and the surface propensities that it endows them with.201,202 How
to devise in vitro drug release testing procedures that would be able to replicate in vivo
conditions better, typically characterized by (a) a more dynamic flow of fluids; (b) specific
local pH profiles that are often disease-dependent; and (c) much more complex and selective
media, is another challenge for the drug delivery field. The natural consequence of this
stance is that same molecules can exhibit dual and quite often antipodal effects on specific
physicochemical processes, as epitomized by polypeptides that can, depending on their

concentration and other experimental conditions, either promote or inhibit growth of crystals
in interaction with them.203–205

If an important advice lurks underneath this observation too, it is the one urging careless and
pretentious researchers to think twice before they indulge in irrational and premature
expansion of the relevance of their findings beyond the scope of experimental conditions
utilized in the lab. In fact, if the history of science teaches us something, it is that the
greatest threats for its proper understanding and progress come not from those who
nondeliberately commit mistakes in their research, but from those who pump up their
conclusions, derived from a limited set of experimental conditions, well beyond the scopes
of their validity. There is no doubt that the burst of the nanotechnology bubble in the years
following the peak in the estimated asset value observed at around 2005, inflated as the
result of unrealistically proximal prospects of nanoscience portrayed by scientists in hunts
for funding, can illustrate the extent to which pretentiousness in the scientific domain can
threaten the projected lines of progress. Hence, as shown in Figure 22(b), while the National
Science Foundation estimated the global market share of nan-otechnologies in 2009 at $1
trillion five years earlier, the true value ended up being only $11.7 billion. Nourishing the
spirit of impartiality and humbleness that naturally springs from the ideals of smallness
attributed to the field of nanoscience and that has ensued the tradition of empiricism since
the times of Renaissance will certainly present a vital challenge in the times of increasingly
entrepreneurial approach to scientific management and thriving collaborations between
academia and industry.

CONCLUSIONS

“‘It is hard to be brave,’ said Piglet, sniffing slightly, ‘when you’re only a Very
Small Animal.’ Rabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said: ‘It
is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in the adventure
before us.”208

This critical review began with the proposition stating that the interest in physical chemistry
of nanoscale phenomena is a natural consequence of the spatial refinement of the human
ability to controllably manipulate the material substratum of our physical reality. It ended
with humble acceptance of the limited nature of our experimentally derivable knowledge,
accentuating searching rather than finding as the key to fruitfully performed scientific
research. In its course, examples were given to illustrate an immense sensitivity of material
properties to grain size on the nanoscale, a phenomenon that directly contributed to the rise
of nanoscience as a special field of scientific inquiry. Alongside this thesis, main systemic
challenges faced by the present and future scientists in this field were outlined. For a while,
we stood on the constantly expanding seashore of the coast of nanoscience and
nanoengineering and envisioned the parts of the island where the most significant advances
may be expected to occur and where most of the attention of scientist in the field is to be
directed: crossing the gap between life science and materials science; increasing
experimentation sensitivity; crisscrossing theoretical and experimental knowledge; and
conjoining top-down and bottom-up synthetic approaches. As for materials and their
application areas discussed, a special emphasis was placed on calcium phosphate
nanoparticles and their usage in controlled drug delivery and other applications of
biomedical relevance. Finally, the rise and prominence of nanoscience is a reminder of the
necessity to reawaken the humble wonder that has been intrinsic to the advancement of
scientific thought ever since its inception. For, as suggested by the standard theory of
measurements and illustrated by the weak interpretation of the uncertainty principle, to
observe the small details of physical reality and interact with them, we, as observers and
causal agents, need to be equally small. Hence, Time to Be Small as the maxim derived

naturally from the herein elaborated idea that the most valuable scientific insights will
increasingly originate from ever finer details of Nature. Expansion of thoughts that would
develop this correlation into humanistic, ethical and aesthetical directions, however, presents
the beginnings of some other, far more interdisciplinary stories than this one.

Critical length scales for some of the key inventions from the history of humanity. A shift
across this scale towards ever smaller dimensions paralleled the advancement of humanity
from the stone age to the modern age. Hence, as the products of the most sophisticated
technologies of the day progressed from prehistoric huts, cutting tools and garments to
modern musical instruments, automobiles and mechanical clocks to computers, nanocopters
and nanomotors, the critical lengths shifted from millimeter to micrometer to nanometer
scale, respectively.

compressibility of cytochrome c, lysozyme and lactoglobulin, indicative of the dimensions
and tertiary structure of the protein, as a function of parameterwthe molar ratio between the
amount of water and the amount of surfactant in the microemulsion, directly proportional to
the size of reverse micelle; (c) a blue shift in the absorbance of water in the microwave
range induced by a decrease in the size of nanoscopic water pools of reverse micelles, along
