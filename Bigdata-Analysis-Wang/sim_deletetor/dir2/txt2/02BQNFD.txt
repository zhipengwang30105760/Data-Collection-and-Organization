Background: Chronic cutaneous wounds represent a major issue in medical care and are often
prone to infections.
Purpose: The aim of this study was the design of a clay mineral-drug nanocomposite based
on montmorillonite and norﬂoxacin (NF, antimicrobial drug) as a powder for cutaneous
application, to enhance wound healing in infected skin lesions.
Methods: The nanocomposite has been prepared by means of an intercalation solution
procedure. Adsorption isotherm, solid-state characterization of the nanocomposite, drug
loading capacity and its release have been performed. Moreover, cytocompatibility, in vitro
ﬁbroblast proliferation and antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Staphylococcus aureus were assessed.
Results: The clay drug adsorption isotherm demonstrates that the mechanism of NF inter-
calation into montmorillonite galleries is the adsorption as one single process, due to the
charge–charge interaction between protonated NF and negatively charged montmorillonite
edges in the interlayer space. Nanocomposite is biocompatible and it is characterized by
antimicrobial activity greater than the free drug: this is due to its nanostructure and controlled
drug release properties.
Conclusion: Considering the results obtained, NF–montmorillonite nanocomposite seems
a promising tool to treat infected skin lesions or skin wounds prone to infection, as chronic
ulcers (diabetic foot, venous leg ulcers) and burns.
Keywords: montmorillonite, norﬂoxacin, nanocomposite, solid state characterization,

Introduction
Wound repair is a complex and tightly regulated physiological process: different
cell types, including immune cells, are involved. Wound healing includes home-
ostasis stage (clotting and immune activation), inﬂammation (recruitment of neu-
trophilis and macrophages, production of cytokine and growth factor), proliferation
phase, tissue neoformation (reepithelialization, angiogenensis and granulation) and
subsequent remodeling of neoformed-tissue.1 Considering the crucial barrier role of
the skin, nonhealing wounds (such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, arterial
insufﬁciency and pressure ulcers) and burns impose substantial morbidity and
mortality, deeply affecting the quality of life with high economic burden2

Severe cutaneous wounds represent a major issue in medical care, with approxi-
mately 300 million chronic and 100 million traumatic wound patients worldwide.
Moreover, chronic wounds affect roughly 37 million of patients globally. Only in
the USA in 2017,3 the skin wounds led to an estimated direct health care cost of

$ 75 billion and an indirect cost of $ 11 billion. The
population aging is likely to dramatically increase the
incidence of chronic wounds due to the rising prevalence
of type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and meta-
bolic syndrome. In addition, surgery, more common in the
elder population, could cause risk of wound complication
especially in patients affected by diabetes.

While acute wounds generally heal without signiﬁcant
interventions, chronic wounds are challenging and are
characterized by an intrinsic inability to heal.

The presence of microbial contamination occurring at
wound bed signiﬁcantly and deeply alter the normal recov-
ery phases, leading to a possible impairment of the healing
path and ﬁnally to nonhealing wounds. Moreover, among
skin wounds, burns require special attention because they
are often prone to infections and to abnormal scarring.1

The employment of antimicrobial agents, particularly
antibiotics, in the treatment of nonhealing wounds is parti-
cularly controversial due to the possible rising of resistance.
However, the nanoparticle-based approach, creating anti-
microbial nanotherapeutics, seems a valid option to elim-
inate bacterial infections, avoiding antimicrobial resistance.
In fact, it is reported that nanomaterials interact with bac-
teria and microorganisms upon multiple interactions such as
electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic and Van der Waals
forces through surface interactions. Moreover, the physico-
chemical properties of nanomaterials allow multiple path-
ways to interact with microorganisms, and this makes them
promising candidates to achieve enhanced therapeutic efﬁ-
cacy against multidrug-resistant infections4 In literature,
different therapeutic approaches based on nanostructures
and several types of nanomaterials (including electrospun
nanoﬁbers, hydrogel,
showed improved antibacterial
properties) are reported.5–9 These systems are generally
polymer-based and prepared with high energy and sophis-
ticated processes.

Recently, the studies focused on nanocomposites based
on clay minerals and drugs and/or biopolymers evidence
the capability of these to interact with biological structures
and open opportunities for tissue engineering and in parti-
cular for wound healing. Nanocomposites are prepared
with simple procedures (spontaneous absorption of organic
moieties into/onto clay following the mixture of the com-
ponents in solution) easy to scale up. Moreover, the var-
ious characteristics of clay minerals in terms of the
composition may offer a range of possibilities to develop
systems able to facilitate both antimicrobial activity of
loaded antibacterial drugs, mainly due to the capability to

decrease water activity10–12 and cell adhesion, prolifera-
tion and neotissue formation.13,14

Given this premise, the aim of this study is to design
and develop nanocomposite based on montmorillonite
(VHS, clay mineral) and norﬂoxacin (NF, antimicrobial
drug) as a powder for cutaneous application intended for
the treatment of infected wounds to enhance their healing.
NF is a synthetic antibacterial ﬂuoroquinolone, active
against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-
negative aerobic bacteria. Its mechanism of action consists
in the inhibition of DNA gyrase enzyme causing an interrup-
tion of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis.15 In the literature, it
is proposed as a prophylactic drug in wound healing, some-
times as a component of scaffolds and wound dressings.15–18
A NF-montmorillonite nanocomposite was prepared by

a powder characterized by means of adsorption isotherm
and solid-state, drug loading capacity and release and
antimicrobial properties.16–22

Materials and methods
Materials
NF (Sigma Aldrich-Merck, Italy) and a pharmaceutical
grade montmorillonite (VHS) (Veegum® HS, Vanderbilt,
USA) were used. VHS was dried in oven (approximately
40°C) for at least 48 hrs prior to be used.

Methods
Clay-drug adsorption isotherm
The intercalation solution technique has been chosen as the
methodology to study the adsorption of NF onto VHS.
Firstly, a ﬁxed amount of clay mineral (100 mg) were
dispersed into 5 mL of a glacial acetic acid:water (1:1) to
achieve the dissolution of NF (initial concentrations of drug
(C0) ranging from 5·10−5 to 1·10−2 M). These dispersions
were protected from light,
in
a thermostatic bath (25°C ±1°C) for 24 hrs and subse-
quently centrifuged (9000 rpm, 45 mins) in order to separate
the solid phase containing the nanocomposite (VHS-NF).
At this point, the equilibrium concentration of NF in the
supernatant (Ce) was determined at 273 nm by UV spectro-
scopy (UV-Vis spectrophotometer Lambda 25, Perkin
Elmer, Italy). It was assumed that the difference between
C0 and Ce corresponded to the amount of NF adsorbed onto
VHS and the amount of drug retained per gram of clay was
calculated. The obtained results were mathematically ﬁtted
(TableCurve 2D, Systat Software Inc., UK) to obtain the

stirred (150 rpm)

monolayer adsorption capacity of the clay and the adsorp-
tion rate constant, according to a mechanist model able to
describe the adsorption of drug molecules onto solid inor-
ganic surfaces.13–25

Solid state characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis was carried out
(X’Pert Pro model, Malven
using a diffractometer
Panalytical)
detector
(X’Celerator) and a spinning sample holder. The diffracto-
gram patterns were recorded using random oriented
mounts with CuKα radiation, operating at 45 kV and 40
mA, in the range 4–60 º2θ.

equipped with

solid-state

a

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra
of the powdery samples were obtained with a JASCO 6,200
apparatus equipped with a Ge ATR. All analyses were per-
formed from 400 to 4,000 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1,
and results processed with Spectra Manager v2 software.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (mod. TGA-50H,
Shimadzu) was performed using a vertical oven and
a precision of 0.001 mg. Approximately 40 mg of each
sample were weighted in aluminum sample pans. The
experiments were performed in 30–950°C range, atmo-
spheric air and a heating rate of 10°C/min. Additionally,
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were
done in a Mettler Toledo and using aluminum crucibles.
The temperature range was deﬁned between 30ºC and
400ºC at a heating rate of 10ºC/min. All the analyses
were done in atmospheric air.

Measurements of zeta potential (ζ) of both the clay and
the nanocomposite were performed in an aqueous solution
with a concentration 0.05% w/V by using a Zetasizer Nano
ZS90 apparatus (Malvern Panalytical, USA).

High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy
was performed by means of a FEI Titan G2 60–300 ultra-
high-resolution transmission electron microscope coupled
with analytical electron microscopy (AEM) performed
with a SUPER-X silicon-drift windowless
energy-
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector. AEM spectra
were saved in mode scanning transmission electron micro-
scopy with a high-angle annular dark ﬁeld detector. X-ray
chemical element maps were also collected. The samples
were directly deposited onto copper grids (300 mesh
coated by farmvar/carbon ﬁlm, Agar Scientiﬁc).

assessed at 275 nm,

An exact amount of nanocomposite or free drug was
dispersed in 3 mL of saline solution (NaCl 0.9% w/v). At
preﬁxed times, 500 µL of dissolution medium was collected
and the total volume replaced. Each sample was ﬁltered (HA
0.22 μm, Millipore) before HPLC analysis.

Antibacterial activity measurements
The antimicrobial activity of nanocomposite compared to
NF as a free drug was evaluated against the bacteria strains
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Pseudomonas aer-
uginosa ATCC 15442. In particular, killing time was deter-
mined as the exposure time required to kill a standardized
microbial inoculum.26 Bacteria used for killing time eva-
luation were grown overnight in Tryptone Soya Broth
(Oxoid; Basingstoke) at 37°C. The bacteria cultures were
centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 mins to separate cells from
broth and then suspended in PBS (pH 7.3). The suspension
was diluted to adjust the number of cells to 1×107–1×108
CFU/ml.

An exact amount of nanocomposite VHS-NF or NF
was added to the microorganism suspensions to obtain 5
μg/mL NF concentrations.

For each microorganism, a suspension was prepared in
PBS without drug and used as control. Bacterial suspen-
sions were incubated at 37°C. Viable microbial counts
were evaluated after contact for 0, 5 and 24 hrs with the
samples and microorganism suspensions grown in the
same conditions and used as control.

The bacterial colonies were enumerated in Tryptone
Soya Agar (Oxoid; Basingstoke) after incubation at 37°C
for 24 hrs.

The microbiocidal effect value was calculated for each
test organisms and contact times according to the follow-
ing equation27

Drug release
NF released from nanocomposite and NF-free drug disso-
lution were assessed by means of HPLC-UV/DAD

where Nc is the number of CFU of the control microbial
suspension and Nd is the number of CFU of the microbial
suspension in presence of drug.

In vitro biocompatibility: ﬁbroblasts
Biocompatibility (cytotoxicity) was evaluated using ﬁbro-
blasts (normal human dermal ﬁbroblasts, from juvenile
foreskin from 2 to 5 passages, PromoCell, WVR, Italy).

Fibroblasts were grown in DMEM (Lonza, I), 10% v/v
(FBS (EuroClone, Italy) and penicillin/streptomycin solution
(pen/strep, 100 UI/100 μm/mL, Sigma Aldrich-Merck, Italy)
VHS (1.2 mg/mL), NF (0.1 mg/mL) and VHS-NF
(VHS: 1.2 mg/mL and NF 0.1 mg/mL) were suspended/
solubilized in cell culture medium and put in contact with
the cells in suspension just after cell seeding in 96-well
plate at seeding density of 35,000 cells/well. Fibroblasts
were grown for 2 days. Fibroblast growth on tissue culture
plastic was considered as standard growth (control).

At preﬁxed end point, cell growth was assessed by
means of MTT test. Brieﬂy, the medium was removed
and 50 µL of MTT solution (Sigma Aldrich, Italy) at
2.5 mg/mL concentration in Hank’s Buffered Salt
Solution pH 7.4 was added to cover each scaffold for
3 hrs. Subsequently, MTT solution was removed from
each well, and the substrates were washed with 200 µL
of PBS. After the removal of PBS, 100 µL of DMSO was
put in each well, and the absorbance was assayed at 570
nm by means of an ELISA plate reader (Imark Absorbance
Reader, Biorad, Italy), with a reference wavelength of 690
nm. Cell viability was expressed as optical density (OD).

Statistical analysis
Statistical differences were evaluated by means of Mann-
Whitney (Wilcoxon) W test (Statgraphics Centurion XV,
Statistical Graphics Corporation, MD, USA). Differences
were considered signiﬁcant at p<0.05, and each signiﬁcant
p-value is reported in the captions.

Results and discussion
Clay-drug adsorption isotherm
Equilibrium adsorption isotherm is shown in Figure 1,
where experimental points are plotted as ns (moles of NF
retained per gram of VHS) vs Ce (mol/l). The kinetic
model used to ﬁt
the adsorption data is expressed by
Equation (1) (Table 1), which describes drug adsorption
as one single process. Montmorillonite is a phyllosilicate
based on two tetrahedral sheets of silica sandwiching
a central octahedral sheet of alumina spaced out interlayer
spaces (galleries). On this basis, protonated NF molecules
interact to the active sites of VHS located at edges and
within interlayer space of montmorillonite, thus forming

calculated correlation coefﬁcient
(R2>0.99, Table 1). Additionally,
the relatively high
value of kinetic equilibrium constant (k) (Table 1) can be
ascribed to great stability of the resultant VHS-NF system.

Solid-state characterizations
X-ray diffractogram patterns of the nanohybrid and pristine
components are plotted in Figure 2. VHS diffractogram
shows reﬂections ascribable to a highly pure homoionic
Na montmorillonite, as previously described.16,24,29,30

In particular, VHS shows d001 basal reﬂection at 7.5º 2θ
which indicates an interlayer space of 12 Å according to
Bragg’s
law. These results are consistent with the
literature.24,31 Diffractogram of VHS-NF also shows typical
reﬂections of montmorillonite with the exception of the basal
reﬂection d001, which shifts to lower 2θ values (5,94º 2θ) in
comparison with the pristine clay mineral. The correspond-
ing interlayer space is expanded (≅15 Å), indicating the
presence of NF molecules adsorbed into clay mineral struc-
ture. Moreover, this new basal reﬂection turns to be sharper
and more intense in comparison with VHS basal reﬂection,

A shoulder at 2,500 cm−1 is attributable to hydrogen
bonded O–H groups, and this also conﬁrms the hydrate
state of NF. Band detected at 1,728 cm−1 belongs to the
C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid.32,35,36 The ﬁrst and

ring are also located in this area (1,400–1,600 cm−1).

Moreover,
C-F vibration.35 Regarding VHS, vibrational band at
3,622 cm−1 belongs to octahedral layer-OH groups (Al-
OH-Al, Al-OH-Mg and Mg-OH-Mg vibrations) typical of
clay minerals. Moreover,
the broad band around
3,400 cm−1 are due to the stretching of OH from hydration
H2O molecules located in the interlayer space of VHS.
Moreover, H2O molecules coordinated to the VHS
exchangeable cations create a band al 1,632 cm−1. The
most
located at
985 cm−1, is due to Si-O-Si in-plane vibration for layered
silicates. Out-of-plane Si-O-Si stretching is responsible for
the shoulder appearing at 1,100 cm−1. On the other hand,
the overlapped band at 914 cm−1 is related to Si-O-Al
stretching mode, while bending vibration of Si-O-Al
occurs at 512 cm−1.24,29,30,37

Vibrational bands of the octahedral Al-OH-Al, Al-OH-
Mg and Mg-OH-Mg are also present in the VHS-NF. The
adsorption of NF in the VHS interlayer space produces
a displacement of the hydrated exchangeable cations, thus
reducing the intensity of the H2O band around 3,400 cm−1.35
Moreover, the presence of the drug in the nanohybrid can be
identiﬁed by its typical vibrational bands located between
1,760 and 1,200 cm−1, all of them coinciding with the NF
spectrum. Particularly, the band at 1,702 cm−1 belongs to
C=O of the carboxylic acid of NF. From 1,200 cm−1 onwards,
the intense vibrations of the clay mineral obscure the NF
bands in the same region. Nonetheless,
the bands in
3,070–2,500 cm−1 range, which correspond to N-H and
CH2 of the drug, are not visible in the VHS-NF spectrum.
This disappearance can be related to the stiffening of the
corresponding functional group due to the position of
adsorbed NF molecules in the interlayer space of VHS.

The TGA analysis of NF showed total drug decomposi-
tion before 630°C (Figure 4 – high panel). The ﬁrst weight
loss gradually occurs in the temperature range from 30°C to
196°C, with an inﬂection point at 100°C. This step is due to

which is an indicator of a highly ordered VHS-NF nanohy-
brid structure. Diffractogram of NF has been found to be
a combination of both anhydrous and sesquihydrate forms
(Figure 2).32–34 Nonetheless, any of these reﬂections are
observed in VHS-NF diffraction pattern,
indicating the
absence of crystalline drug on the nanohybrid surface. The
XRPD analysis suggests that the nanocomposite is charac-
terized by NF intercalation into the VHS galleries.

Figure 3 reports the FTIR spectra of VHS-NF in com-
parison to NF and VHS. The infrared spectrum of NF
shows typical bands of a hydrated form of NF. In particu-
lar, the broad bands between 3,600 and 3,250 cm−1 belong
to hydration water stretching (O-H stretching vibration, at
about 3404 cm−1) together with N-H vibrations of the

TGA thermogram of VHS (Figure 4 – high panel)
shows a ﬁrst slight weight loss of 2% (w/w), which corre-

a typical clay mineral dehydroxylation step40 is present

VHS-NF nanocomposite shows TGA thermogram
characterized by overlapped events (Figure 4 – high
panel). In particular, it is evident that water loss is fol-
lowed by the decomposition of NF and dehydroxylation of
clay. Considering that NF fully decomposes before 630ºC,
the difference in weight loss between VHS and VHS-NF
reveals that VHS-NF is characterized by 16% (w/w) NF
loading. Moreover, NF is present in an amorphous state in
VHS-NF since melting event is not evident in VHS-NF
DSC thermogram (Figure 4 – low panel) while the actual
NF loading can be justiﬁed by the exothermic phenom-
enon observable at 300–345°C.

A 0.05% w/v VHS aqueous suspension is character-
ized by zeta potential of −43.5±0.9 mV, thus conﬁrming
the negative net charge of the clay. A 0.05% w/v VHS-
NF nanocomposite aqueous suspension shows a zeta
potential of −15.9±0.3 mV. VHS and NF probably inter-
act via electrostatic bonds partially shielding the nega-
tive charges located into VHS galleries. The dissolution
of NF in acetic acid during the nanocomposite prepara-
tion causes the protonation of its nitrogen atom in the
piperazine ring. In this condition, NF in solution, posi-
tively charged, can interact with the negatively charges
in the interlayer space of VHS, normally compensated
by exchangeable cations increasing the zeta potential.
Similar results were reported for clay–cationic moieties
interaction products.39,40

High-resolution TEM microphotographs of VHS sam-
ple (Figure 5A) show the typical layered morphology of
montmorillonite. The EDX analysis performed in the
marked zone (red square) conﬁrms the nature of VHS,
thanks to the presence of Si, Al and O, together with Mg
and Fe and the typical exchangeable cations (Na, K and Ca).

the evaporation of water and corresponds to the ﬁrst
endothermic event of the corresponding DSC curve (Figure
4 – low panel). Nonetheless, the presence of an inﬂection
point could be related to different types of crystallization
water. In fact, different hydrated forms of NF have been
reported in literature, such as dihydrate and sesquihydrate,
among others.38 In particular, water evaporation of NF dihy-
drate form is described as a two different step process
although this is not visible in DSC proﬁle and on the contrary
it is evident in TGA proﬁle.38 These results are related to the
presence of both dihydrate and sesquihydrate forms (as con-
ﬁrmed by XRPD diffraction peaks) having overlapped steps
of H2O molecule evaporation in DSC. The sharp and intense
endothermic peak located at 227°C (T onset 218°C) corre-
sponds to NF melting point, conﬁrmed by the absence of

drug starts at 300°C according to TGA proﬁle and three
overlapped steps (inﬂection point at ~370°C and ~500°C)
are attributable to the loss of different functional groups of

Figure 5 TEM microphotographs and EDX analysis of VHS (A), NF (B) and VHS-NF (C) together with EDX mapping of VHS-NF (D).
Abbreviations: NF, norﬂoxacin; VHS, montmorillonite; VHS-NF, montmorillonite/norﬂoxacin nanocomposite.

NF (Figure 5B) microphotographs conﬁrm NF crystal-
linity and agree with XRDP results. Moreover, the EDX
analysis evidences the presence of C, O and N (typical of
organic compounds) and that of F peculiar of NF
molecule.

VHS-NF nanocomposite (Figure 5C) shows a morphol-
ogy similar to that of VHS. The NF crystals are not detectable
in this sample, in agreement with XRPD results (no peak of
NF diffraction in VHS-NF sample, Figure 2) although the NF
presence in nanocomposite is conﬁrmed by means of the
EDX analysis. The elemental composition evidences the
characteristic components of montmorillonite (Si, Al, Mg)
and those of organic compounds (C, N, O); moreover, F is
also detectable as NF indicator. Additionally, EDX maps
(Figure 5D) corroborate not only the presence of VHS and
NF in nanocomposite but also the homogeneous distribution
of NF into montmorillonite, conﬁrming the presence of NF

monolayer adsorbed onto the interlayer spaces, as resulted
from adsorption studies.

Drug release
Figure 6 reports the NF release proﬁles (%) evaluated for NF
and VHS-NF nanocomposite. The dissolution of NF from
free drug is very rapid and reaches 80% within the ﬁrst hour
and the plateau value in 2 hrs at 100% of NF release.

VHS-NF shows a signiﬁcantly lower NF release proﬁle
and the whole dose is released in 48 hrs evidencing
a controlled release. Considering the application (skin lesions),
the capability of the system to control drug release should
decrease the number of applications over time. This is an
important aspect to allow the healing of lesion since the
frequent medical treatment could impair the granulation tissue
and new tissue formation. Moreover, the slower release proﬁle
of NF could allow to control microbial growth over time.

Antimicrobial properties
Figure 7 reports microbiocidal effect vs time proﬁles of
NF released
a)
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and b) Staphylococcus aureus.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common Gram-negative,
rod-shaped bacterium, facultative anaerobe, of considerable
medical importance. It is recognized as a multidrug-resistant
pathogen for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic
resistance mechanisms and its association with hospital-
acquired infections such as various sepsis syndromes.
P. aeruginosa is considered opportunistic insofar as serious
infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions,
most notably traumatic burns.

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, round-shaped
bacterium and, as P. aeruginosa, it is a facultative anaerobe. It

is an usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently
found on the skin, usually acting as a commensal. However, it
can also become an opportunistic pathogen, being a common
cause of skin infections. The onset of S. aureus strains anti-
biotic-resistant (such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus) is
a worldwide emergence in clinical medicine.

NF is reported in the literature as effective against both
P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having a MIC of 2 μg/mL in
both cases.39 However, the microbicidal effect is slightly
higher against P. aeruginosa than that against S. aureus.
The loading of NF in montmorillonite in VHS-NF nano-
composite signiﬁcantly increases NF microbicidal effect.
The increase of NF potency due to the nanocomposite is
probably due to high surface area to volume ratio, which
increases the contact area with target organisms.40

Fibroblast in vitro biocompatibility
Figure 8 reports bioavailability (OD, optical density) eval-
uated for VHS (1.2 mg/mL), NF (0.1 mg/mL) and VHS-
NF (VHS: 1.2 mg/mL and NF 0.1 mg/mL). VHS and NF
are characterized by OD values not signiﬁcantly different
from the control (growth medium, standard growth condi-
tions). The nanocomposite, VHS-NF, is characterized by
OD signiﬁcantly lower than that of the control although it
is higher than 80% and this is normally considered as the
lower limit for the cytocompatibility.

VHS, NF and VHS-NF are characterized by no signiﬁ-
cantly different OD to suggest similar behaviour. Anyhow, it
should be considered that the cytocompatibility is assayed to
a 20-fold concentration higher than that considered for anti-
microbial assay. This evidences that nanocomposite does not
impair ﬁbroblast growth also at concentrations higher than
those effective against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus as assessed
in the antimicrobial assay.

Conclusions
NF is loaded into montmorillonite to have a nanocomposite
by means of adsorption mechanism, as one single process. In
particular, protonated NF molecules interact with the active
sites of montmorillonite located at edges and within its
interlayer space, thus forming a drug monolayer onto the
clay mineral interlayer surface. NF in the nanocomposites
is in an amorphous state, and its loading is homogeneous and
causes an expansion of montmorillonite interlayer spaces.
Moreover, the nanocomposite causes a prolonged NF release
over time. The nanocomposite is characterized by good
biocompatibility in vitro toward ﬁbroblasts, and it is able to

García-Villén et al

increase antimicrobial potency of the free drug against
P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, Gram-negative and Gram-
positive bacteria, respectively, that are often a concurrent
cause of wound chronicization, leading to a possible impair-
ment of the healing path and ﬁnally to nonhealing wounds.
NF-montmorillonite nanocomposite demonstrates to
possess suitable properties as a tool to enhance wound
healing in infected wounds:
the possibility to use
a ﬂexible dosage, as a powder for cutaneous application,
should also allow easy administration, depending on lesion
dimensions.
